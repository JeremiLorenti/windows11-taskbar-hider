# Windows 11 Taskbar Hider and Full Screen Utilizer

This mod allows you to completely hide the Windows 11 taskbar and utilize the full screen. It's reversible, so you can easily show the taskbar again when needed.

## Usage

1. **IMPORTANT**: You MUST set Windows taskbar behavior to "Automatically hide the taskbar" BEFORE enabling this mod. This setting is required for the mod to allow full screen resolution without preserving taskbar space.
2. Enable the mod to hide the taskbar and use full screen.
3. Disable the mod to show the taskbar and restore normal screen area.
4. Even with the taskbar hidden, you can still access the Start menu by pressing the Win key on your keyboard.

**Note**: If you don't set the taskbar to auto-hide before enabling the mod, you may not get the full screen utilization as intended.
